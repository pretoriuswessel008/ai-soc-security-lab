# AI SOC Security Lab

Hands-on cybersecurity lab demonstrating SOC-style detection, alerting, and AI-assisted anomaly monitoring using Python.

## 🎯 Objective
This lab simulates how Security Operations Centers (SOC) detect, correlate, and respond to suspicious activity in logs.
It focuses on **security logic and architecture**, not just tooling.

## 🧠 What This Lab Covers
- Log ingestion and parsing
- Security event filtering (WARNING / ERROR)
- Brute-force detection (failed logins)
- Rule-based alerting
- AI-style anomaly detection (frequency-based)
- Automated alert generation
- SOC-style monitoring workflow

## 🗂️ Project Structure
data/ -> Sample log data
src/ -> Detection and monitoring scripts
docs/ -> Lab walkthrough and explanations


## ⚙️ Tools & Skills Used
- Python
- Regex
- Log correlation
- SOC alert logic
- AI-assisted anomaly detection
- Automation concepts

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Navigate to the `src` directory
2. Run: python soc_monitor.py
3. View alerts in the terminal and in `soc_alerts.txt`

## 📌 Why This Lab Matters
This project demonstrates **how SOC tools and AI-driven security platforms work internally**, without relying on enterprise software.

It reflects real-world security thinking used in SIEM, SOAR, and AI cybersecurity architectures.
